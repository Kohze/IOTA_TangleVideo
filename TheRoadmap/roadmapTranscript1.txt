After we introduced IOTA in our last video, we will take the next 3 minutes to evaluate what IOTA stands for and have a look at the implications of the IOTA development road map. 
Thanks to advancement of secure cryptographic protocols, Crypto Currencies evolved in recent years to a viable and increasingly accepted way to pay for daily commodities. Since every payment is a transfer of information -  crypto currencies are in its core protected information transfer protocols.
THE IOTA team highlighted from an early beginning THAT IOTA’s crypto protocols can not only be used to validate transactions and studied the specific needs in a world of automated IOT devices to create an ecosystem with sustainable and real-world value. 
While the IOTA’s core protocol is lightweight and simple, the IOTA extension interface, also known as (IXI), offers a variety extension modules allow developers to create the so called “ledger of everything”. 
Let’s move to our virtual test lab to simulate various IOT device scenarios.  
One of the most exciting IXI modules is the Identity of things implementation for IOT devices. Identity of things allows to give each IOT device to share meta information such as a unique Identifier and the current state of the device. By allowing an IOT device to change its own metadata it can react to specific environmental challenges such as malfunctions or insufficient capacities to handle certain problems.
With the Masked Authenticated Messaging function, also known as MAM, the device then triggers a reaction by sending an encrypted message to other IOT devices in the network. Depending on the specific environment, other IOT helper devices can then react by changing their own behaviour. This way a support IOT device could repair, support, or distance itself from the affected device.
Such communication functionality also opens the opportunity to integrate a master server that collects all messages transmitted including the outcome of each situation. That way, the sever could perform machine learning optimization algorithms to improve situation specific reaction patterns. Since the tangle only stores transactions since its last snapshot, a mechanism that constantly saves all addresses and assets, the IOTA team is in the process to integrate a “permanode” functionality that allows to store all tangle information permanently. 
And to finally complete the demands of IOT devices in the IOTA environment, a transmission gateway called “Oracle” is under development to feed all network devices with frequently updated data that either only exist outside the network or are useful to be shared across all tangle nodes. 
This video only covered a small subset of possibilities that a successful IOTA implementation offer. If you got interested and want to learn more about IOTA, additional articles are available on the official iota roadmap page linked below.
